          Autostars is the most flexible theme we have ever built, nothing is
          defined for a single niche. You can define the Listings name as you
          want, create the product attributes as much as you need, use whatever
          name you want for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Set your own set of fields for the front end submission form, for
          listings comparison, listing details or what ever you can imagine
          while creating a website for front end listings.
